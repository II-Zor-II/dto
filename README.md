A Data Transfer Object (DTO) is an object used to pass structured data between layers in your application.  It aims to provide a quick and easy way to define structure objects, filter the data, and reuse structures between objects.  

For example, instead of passing your view layer just any array, you can define a DTO and use type-hinting to ensure that your views will always have the data attributes they need.
